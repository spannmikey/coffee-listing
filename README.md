# Coffee listing application

This was a challenge to help me understand and practice my react skills. It helped me understand how to render data to a screen from JSON data and expanded my knowledge on the useRef hook

I am challenging my frontend skills until I get better and efficient enough to do tasks like these in my sleep.
